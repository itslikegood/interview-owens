### Welcome!
Hi Dave!  Joey from ADP here.  Remember the design excercise we went through during our interview?  I would like for you to take the next step and implement.  Your approach to the design was well recieved, and you made some great assumptions and asked the right questions.  

Treat this excercise as something you would do while working at your day job.  When you're done, please submit a pull request and we'll discuss.

#### Spec Overview
Design a small application that first and foremost is a video viewing web app for the modern day browser. Base your implementation on the visual specification (*See adjacent PNG for design spec*) we reviewed.

The app should be written using a modern day framework.

#### Assumptions
1. Please mock out any APIs within your client side code.
  a. Bonus points for creating a server side mock api (your language of choice), no need to setup a database.
2. Deliver runable code.  I should be able to check the code out and execute a working app.
3. Any questions you have, please use GitHub "Issues" to discuss.


Good luck!
Please submit your PR by the end of the week (Friday Feb 2).
